# TensorFlow Image Classification with CIFAR-10

## Project Overview
This project implements an image classification model using TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. The goal is to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify these images into one of the 10 categories: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck.

The project is documented in a Jupyter notebook (`index.ipynb`), which includes data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results using a confusion matrix heatmap.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.11 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `tensorflow` (for building and training the CNN)
  - `numpy` (for numerical operations)
  - `matplotlib` (for plotting)
  - `seaborn` (for visualization of the confusion matrix)

You can install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Structure
- `index.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for loading the CIFAR-10 dataset, building and training the CNN model, and evaluating the model with a confusion matrix heatmap.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Download the Project**:
   - Download the `index.ipynb` file and this `README.md` to your local machine, or clone the repository if applicable.

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Ensure Python 3.11 or later is installed.
   - Install the required libraries by running:
     ```bash
     pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn
     ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open `index.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute the cells in `index.ipynb` sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the data, build and train the model, and visualize the results.

## Usage
The `index.ipynb` notebook is organized into sections for easy navigation:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - Loads necessary libraries, including TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

2. **Loading and Preprocessing the CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   - Loads the CIFAR-10 dataset using `tensorflow.keras.datasets.cifar10`.
   - Reshapes the labels for compatibility with the model.

3. **Dataset Exploration**:
   - Provides details about the dataset, including its structure, classes, and split (50,000 training images, 10,000 testing images).
   - Defines a `plot_sample` function to visualize individual images with their corresponding class labels.

4. **Model Building and Training**:
   - Constructs a CNN using TensorFlow's Keras API with layers such as `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `BatchNormalization`, `Dropout`, and `Dense`.
   - Note: The notebook provided does not include the model training code, but it is assumed to be part of the workflow before generating predictions.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Generates a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Visualizes the confusion matrix as a heatmap using Seaborn, with class labels for interpretability.
   - Includes an analysis of the heatmap to identify correct predictions and misclassifications.

To use the notebook:
- Run each cell in order to reproduce the results.
- Modify hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of epochs) or model architecture in the relevant sections to experiment with different configurations.
- Use the `plot_sample` function to visualize specific images by passing an index, e.g., `plot_sample(0)` to display the first training image.

## Results
The notebook includes a confusion matrix heatmap to evaluate the model's performance. The heatmap highlights:
- **Correct Predictions**: High values along the diagonal indicate accurate classifications for each class.
- **Misclassifications**: Off-diagonal values show where the model confused one class with another, with darker shades indicating more significant errors.
- **Class-Specific Performance**: The heatmap helps identify which classes the model struggles with, guiding potential improvements.

## Limitations
- The provided notebook snippet does not include the model training code, so users must implement or assume a trained model to generate `y_pred_classes`.
- The CIFAR-10 dataset's small image size (32x32) can limit model accuracy compared to larger datasets.
- The model may require hyperparameter tuning or additional techniques (e.g., data augmentation) to improve performance.

## Future Improvements
- Add data augmentation to enhance model robustness.
- Experiment with deeper architectures or transfer learning using pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
- Include additional evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) for a comprehensive analysis.
- Implement cross-validation to ensure model generalization.
